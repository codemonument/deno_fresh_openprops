# Readme 

A Deno library by @codemonument to help integrating openprops with Deno's web framework 'fresh'.

**COMMING SOON! ðŸ¤©**

## Usage 

1. Create a folder called `css` on the top level of your repo, for all your css files which should have openprops available 
2. 

## TODOs

- Add a complete 'fresh' installation in example folder (same technique as in rx_webstreams)
- extract the handler for postcss processing together with the cache into an easy function which can simply be dropped into a file-based route file
