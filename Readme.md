# Readme 

A Deno library by @codemonument to help integrating openprops with Deno's web framework 'fresh'.

**COMMING SOON! 🤩**

## TODOs

- Add a complete 'fresh' installation in example folder (same technique as in rx_webstreams)
- extract the handler for postcss processing together with the cache into an easy function which can simply be dropped into a file-based route file
